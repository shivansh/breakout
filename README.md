#breakout

The first game, the one where the journey of Java exploration began :smile: <br>
This is a small and simple game made in the freshman days when I started programming (and was enjoying OOP).

```
          _|_|_|                                  _|                              _|
          _|    _|  _|  _|_|    _|_|      _|_|_|  _|  _|      _|_|    _|    _|  _|_|_|_|
          _|_|_|    _|_|      _|_|_|_|  _|    _|  _|_|      _|    _|  _|    _|    _|
          _|    _|  _|        _|        _|    _|  _|  _|    _|    _|  _|    _|    _|
          _|_|_|    _|          _|_|_|    _|_|_|  _|    _|    _|_|      _|_|_|      _|_|
```

## System Requirements
* Your favourite IDE (say Eclipse or NetBens)
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment

## How to play ?
You can directly open the repo in Eclipse (or any of your favourite IDE).

If you rarely leave your terminal and/or prefer not using GUI, continue reading.<br>
A small set of commands need to be executed to start playing. All dependencies have been already taken care of.
```
▶ javac -cp acm.jar ./src/BreakoutGame.java
▶ java -cp .:acm.jar ./src/BreakoutGame.class
```
This should launch a new applet with the main screen of the game.

You will soon be able to play the game directly by launching **play.html** which uses `appletviewer`.

## Instructions
Play as you wish !!

## Want to make changes ?
You can modify most of the game settings yourself (Not that there are many things to change :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )

## Todo
* Update the above section.
* Add points to keep track of scores.
* Add eventual build up to the speed of the ball.
* Fix the html file.
