===============
The first game, the one where the journey of Java exploration began :')
This is just a small and simple game made in the early days when I started programming (and was enjoying OOP).

## How to play ?
You can directly open the repo in Eclipse (or any of your favourite IDE).

If you rarely leave your terminal and hate GUI, continue reading.
You will have to execute a small set of commands to start playing.
All dependencies have been already taken care of.
```
javac -cp acm.jar ./src/BreakoutGame.java
java -cp .:acm.jar ./src/BreakoutGame.class
```

## Instructions
Play as you wish :P

## Want to make changes ??
You can modify most of the game settings yourself (Not that there are many things to change :P), starting off by reducing the enormous ball which I made for convenience while playing.

## Todo
* Update the above section.
* Add points to keep track of scores.
* Add eventual build up to the speed of the ball.
